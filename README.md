# Rick and Morty Character Search App

This app uses the Vue.js JavaScript framework to allow a user to search for characters from the Rick and Mort show.

### The objectives of the app were:
* Demonstrate the ability to create a Vua app with multiple components and templates.

### The app carries out the following:
* Fetches a list of character information from an online API
* Allows the user to search for a specific character by typing their name into a box
* Automatically lists the first result from the search as the user is typing the character name
* Results show character name, gender, species, status and origin.
